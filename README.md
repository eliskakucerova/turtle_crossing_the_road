### Turtle crossing the road

The project is simple game when the turtle is supposed to cross the road and not be hit by the car. 
When the turtle gets to the finish line, the game is refreshed and the speed of the car increases. 
  
The project is written in Python. OOP was used to create three seperated modules with classes: car_manager, scoreboard and player.

### Setup

Python 3.10.3 version was used. Are you uncertain about your version? Use command line `python --version`.

The project depends on the turtle - Turtle graphics - Python, `time` library and random.

### How to run?

You can run the script from PyCharm, which was used during creating the code, but it depends on your preferences.
 
### Important information

The code was written by me as the part of the online course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Projects created by Dr. Angela Yu.
The tutorial was used mainly to check whether the code is correct and for little help.
